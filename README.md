## Southern District in San Francisco leads for largest number of crimes reported

I have selected San Franscisco crime data for my assignment. By looking at the data I have generated few charts. My conlusions from the charts are:

1. Larceny/Theft is the most common crime observed in San Francisco.

2. Southern District leads for highest number of crimes reported in San Francisco.

Out of the majority of crimes reported, Larceny/Theft is most common.

3. I assumed that the number of crimes reported would follow a specific day pattern. But I was surprised to see that there is no such patterns.

![Day of a week wise crime counts](https://github.com/manojampolu/datasci-crime_analytics_visualization/blob/master/crime_rate_day_of_week.png)
But the number of thefts reported on a Saturday are high.

However, the number of crimes reported between 5PM - 7PM are high.

4. I think the number crimes resolved in an area plays a very important role in curbing the numner of crimes in an area. Low crimes are reported in areas where the crimes resolved are high in number.
